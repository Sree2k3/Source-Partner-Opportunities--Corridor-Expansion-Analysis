# README for Source Partner Opportunities- Corridor Expansion Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes data related to source partner opportunities using datasets obtained from Superset. The primary datasets utilized in this analysis are `P_B.csv`, `TP_B.csv`, and `R_D.csv`, which contain relevant information for processing and generating insights. The dataset used for this analysis is the **TerraPay Disha Summary**.

## Data Sources

1. **P_B.csv**: This file contains information about source partners.
2. **TP_B.csv**: This file includes data on source countries and their corresponding GSV (Gross Sales Value).
3. **R_D.csv**: This file provides details about regional directors associated with the source partners.

Please ensure to review the columns in each of these files to understand the structure and the data they contain.

## Output Files

The project generates two output files that represent the same dataset:

1. **Potential_partner.csv**: This file contains filtered data based on specific criteria related to source partners and their opportunities.
2. **Partner_opportunities.csv**: This file is a sorted version of `Potential_partner.csv`, organized by grouping the data by `source_partner` and `source_country`, and sorted by GSV (Gross Sales Value) for easier analysis.

## Usage

To utilize this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary CSV files (`P_B.csv`, `TP_B.csv`, and `R_D.csv`) in your working directory.
2. Run the provided Python scripts to process the data, filter it based on GSV values, and generate the output files.
3. The final output, `Partner_opportunities.csv`, will contain the sorted data, which can be used for further analysis or reporting.

## Conclusion

This project aims to streamline the analysis of source partner opportunities by leveraging data from Superset. The final output file, `Partner_opportunities.csv`, serves as a valuable resource for understanding and evaluating partner opportunities effectively.
